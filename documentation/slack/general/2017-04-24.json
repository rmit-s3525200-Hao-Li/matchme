So now we have two models: User (email, password, password_confirmation, admin), and Profile (first_name, last_name, gender, etc). I also added interests to Profile. Profile and user have seperate forms. <@U4F33615G> I completely changed the form not because I didn't like what you did, but because I had to separate it out and put in different fields. It doesn't look too great right now but if you have time later you can change it a bit. <@U4FP56WS2> You have a big task now: fix the failing errors. They're failing because the db has changed. We also need tests for Profile model.",
